# istdsa_project - 3

We have completed our third project as Team-2 in Istanbul Data Science Academy's Data Science Bootcamp. This is my third project where I experienced all the steps of an imbalanced classification project for beginners.

In this project, which we briefly call 'User Type Prediction', citibike® asked us to develop an application that predicts the user type as Subscriber or Customer when some features are entered as input.
